# Calculator for calculation of 2 or 3 linear equations using Cramer's Rule!

Hello, This my first java project.

We are using a very simple java code to solve the unknowns in the three equations using Cramer's rule.

## How to use?

### For two equations:
```
a1x + b1y = d1
a2x + b2y = d2
```
Here you have to give the values of a1, a2, b1, b2, c1 and c2 from your equations.


### For three equations:
```
a1x + b1y + c1z = d1
a2x + b2y + c2z = d2
a13 + b3y + c3z = d3
```
Here you have to give the values of a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, c1, c2, c3, d1, d2 and d3 from your equations.

> You can only use this with two or three equations!
