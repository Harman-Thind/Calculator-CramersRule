# Calculator for Cramer's Rule for a 3x3 equation

Hello, This my first java project.

We are using a very simple java code to solve the unknowns in the three equations using Cramer's rule.

### How to use?
```
a1x + b1y + c1z = d1
a2x + b2y + c2z = d2
a13 + b3y + c3z = d3
```
Here you have to full the values of a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, c1, c2, c3, d1, d2 and d3 from your equation and that's it. It will five you answers in decimal form.

> You can only use this with three equations!
